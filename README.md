# Transaction App

## Description of the Project
This application allows you to get a good glance of all your transactions, while also allowing you to add any transaction you would like to. It also displays different reports in neat format.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add my deposit transactions so I can track my deposits.
- As a user, I want to add my payment transactions so I can track all payments I make.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all my transactions so I can better manage my money and understand what I’m spending it on.
- As a user I want to see only my deposits so I can better understand where my money is coming from.
- As a user I want to see only my payments so I can better understand where I am spending my money.
- As a user I want to see a report on my transactions from the current month to the current date so I can see my transactions for the month.
- As a user I want to see a report on my transactions from the past month only so I can see my transactions for the previous month.
- As a user, I want to see a report on my transactions from the previous year only so I can review my spending and income from last year.
- As a user I want to see a report on my transactions from the current year to current date so I can better see my incoming and outgoing money for the year.
- As a user, I want to search my transactions by vendor so I can view all payments or deposits from specific vendors.
- As a user I want to create my own filter for a report so it’s more flexible than the predefined reports.

## Future Work
- **Transaction Categories/Tags**: Allow users to categorize transactions (e.g., Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment, Savings) for better insights.
- **Batch Entry Mode**: Enable users to add multiple deposits or payments in succession without returning to the home screen after each entry.
- **Running Balance Tracking**: Display a running balance that updates with each transaction, allowing users to see insights about balance throughout months/years.
- **Total Values**: Show the total number of entries and amount (total deposited, total spent,etc..) for each report view to provide improved financial insights.
